                    <p>Hello, everyone! I’m Andrew and welcome to my website. Here you can find some information about
                        me.
                        Head to my portfolio to see some of the work I completed during my coding bootcamp at the
                        University
                        of Washington. Feel free to send me a message or ask a question via the contact page.</p>
                    <p>A little about myself, I’m a UW graduate with a degree in linguistics with eight years of
                        teaching
                        experience in Cambodia. I’ve been working as a first-grade teacher in the capitol Phnom Penh for
                        the
                        last two years and despite enjoying the profession immensely, I’m not interested in continuing
                        down
                        the career pathway in education stateside. Web development never really stood out to me until
                        recently but being really detail-oriented and naturally interested in the syntax and logic of
                        computer language has made me want to pursue it professionally. The design aspects of web
                        development also appeal to my need for a creative outlet. I'm excited to make the leap into the
                        web development industry upon completion of this bootcamp. </p>
                    <p>Outside of work and studying, I love to hike and travel. While living in Asia, I was able to
                        travel
                        regularly throughout the region. Hiking along Tiger Leaping Gorge in Yunnan Province of China
                        was a
                        highlight, as was jungle trekking and orangutan viewing in Borneo. Despite my love for travel
                        I’m a
                        bit of a homebody and prefer to spend my evening reading, watching YouTube or playing board
                        games
                        particularly Disney trivia games.</p>
